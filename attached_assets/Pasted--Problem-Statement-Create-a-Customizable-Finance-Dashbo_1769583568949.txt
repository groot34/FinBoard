## **FAQ**

### **API and Data Handling**

**Q: How do I handle different API response formats?**

A: Implement a flexible data mapper that can handle various JSON structures. Consider creating adapters for common API formats.

**Q: What happens if the API request limit is reached?**

A: The website may temporarily stop fetching new data until the limit resets. A message should indicate that the API limit has been reached and suggest trying again later.

**Q: How do I create a new API key?**

A:

1. Visit the API provider’s website (e.g., Alpha Vantage).
2. Sign in or create an account.
3. Navigate to the API section or dashboard.
4. Generate a new API key.
5. Copy the key.
6. Update your application configuration with the new API key.

**Q: What are common API errors and how should I handle them?**

A: Common errors include rate limits, invalid API keys, CORS issues, and network errors. Cache API responses to avoid rate limits. Always follow provider documentation.

**Q: What should I do when API rate limits are exceeded?**

A: The app should gracefully notify the user and retry once limits reset.
